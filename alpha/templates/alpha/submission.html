    <p class= "normal"><b>A Brief Rundown: </b>This website is meant for anyone who'd like to keep a personal record of their games, and their attitude while playing League. The first option allows you to enter in your data. The second option will show you your winrate and average attitude score. Both are based on the entire season collectively, rather than the 20 game system used by Op.gg. The thrid option will show you your winrates with people who appear in more than 1/4 of your games. This is useful for looking at your rates for duo partner(s), or randoms, over the course of a season rather than over a 20 game window. I don't want this to be a replacement for Op.gg or similar services. Those sevices are great and there's nothing wrong with them. Rather than recreating them, I would like this to be a service that shows similar data like winrates, but that goes beyond the 20 game window, and that will allow you to see your attitude based on numerical input. This is something that you will build yourself from the data you input, so it has the potential to be a great way to review your season from more than just a winrate perspective. The usefulness really only grows the more you input data. If you don't think you're interested in reviewing your progress in this way, by all means do it how you'd like to, and thanks for giving this a read. Enjoy the service, and good luck out there on the Rift.</p>

    <p class = "normal"><b>How it works: </b>This site is really just a front end experience for a program that I wrote. The program works by reading a file on your computer, and doing simple math on the information that it pulls from the file. The way it works is very simple, and pretty dull, but the interesting part comes from the interpretation of the data. I won't be storing anything about you, and it should run based on the file that is local to your computer, so you don't need to worry about tacking or anything like that. If you don't share your data no one will know it. In the future when I know about password encryption and other web security measures, I might add a login feature to the page, but as of right now everything is stored locally. I plan on having the file appear your desktop, so hopefully it'll be there and it will be called something like "Records" or "games". It will be an csv file, so you'll need Excel or some similar program to open it as intended.</p>
